Analysis for fluoresecent traces from axonally-targeted GCaMP8 following segmentation and extraction in suite2p (python)
Traces have been normalised and saved as excel files - Can adapt to extract directly from Suite2p output and normalise in one process if required. 
"AxonalBouton_PeakDetection" is used to optimize detection parameters as creates visuals for every trace with peak detection, 
"AxonalBouton_PeakDetection_Batch" is simplified version without graphing suitable to post-optimisation batch processing
